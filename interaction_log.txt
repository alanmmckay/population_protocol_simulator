The simulator can be a means for the interaction log and the population protocol
to work in tandem.
    -It should be able to invoke, revoke, and rollback interactions.
        -When conducting a rollback, it will be necessary to trace back through
        the states of each agent for each previous interaction.
    -There also needs to exist a means to gather analytical data of the population
    as a whole.
        -Thus when a rollback occurs, this collection of data also needs to be
        altered
        
Here is what is currently in place:
-transactions is a dictionary composed of interaction data, where each index is
numeric.
    -interaction data is an edge and the states of each agent before the interaction
    occurs
-indexes is a list of indexes which is used to determine the sequential order of each
interaction. This is necessary for moving items into the partition list.
-interactions is a dictionary whose indices are each edge within a graph. Each key 
represents an interaction count.

-partition is a list of interactions which are exempt from a rolled back configuration.
-partition_indexes is a list of indices of the items in partition. This is necessary
for repopulating the transactions dictionary
-partition interactions is a dictionary that keeps track of the interaction count for
the items in the partition list

Notice that when a rollback occurs that the transactions and interactions dictionaries
aren't changed. The partition properties are changed:
    -This means that if a user wants to look at a previous configuration, that the 
    interaction properties will be used to compute the **differences**
